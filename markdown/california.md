# My favorite vacation

This summer, my husband and I traveled down _most of_ the coast of **California**. It was our first major road trip, _and the first time either of us had been to California_. Though the trip was a little too long, we really enjoyed the experience. We flew out from Missouri and spent two weeks seeing sites and trying some of the best food. Below you will find more details!


## Trip Overview

* San Francisco
* Sonoma Valley
* Monterey and Carmel-By-The-Sea
* Big Sur
* Santa Barbara
* Malibu
* Los Angeles

### Highlights

I thought I would really love SF, but it didn't end up being my favorite. I liked the city, but we had an issue with our hotel--they only had the heat on and their way of fixing our room was for us to open the patio doors, but then we couldn't sleep due to the noise outside.  We stayed in Japantown and had delicious ramen on our first night. We found a really great small bus tour of the city that we enjoyed (and we got lots of great scenic pictures). I would love to go back another time and explore SF more.

Sonoma Valley was beautiful. It is considered the more affordable sister to Napa Valley. Somehow, we only managed to go to **one** winery while we were there. We did, however, enjoy a hot air balloon ride early one morning, complete with a sunrise and champagne.

### My Favorites

1. Big Sur --- the scenery and coastal views were stunning. 
2. Carmel-By-The-Sea --- This cozy town seemed like such a nice place to getaway, relax, and enjoy some good food. 
3. Malibu --- We stayed up in the Topanga mtns. and the views from our place were crazy beautiful. I just wanted to stay at that house and laze around. We didn't like Malibu nearly as much.

My husband says:
>"I think Carmel-By-The-Sea was my favorite because we rode bikes along the beach and saw a ton of elephant seals.

#### What I Would Do Differently

This was our first trip where we were constantly moving to new cities every few days. The things I would change are: stay at least three nights at any location and shorten the trip a few days. It was very ambitious for us to stay in 6 locations within two weeks. Next time, I hope we narrow our scope so we can enjoy our trip even more!
